WORKSHOP: Data Visualization with R and ggplot2
--------------

This github repository contains the materials and slides that I prepared for the 2-hour workshop on data visualization with R and ggplot2 organized by the NYU Politics Data Lab in October 2013.

The purpose of the workshop was to introduce ggplot2 as a tool that allows researchers in the social science to easily create elegant and effective graphs. 

It was structured in two parts. First, the R scripts `01_ggplot_basics.R` and `01_scales_axes_legends.R' introduce the grammar of graphics using an analysis of Facebook posts about the government shutdown as a running example. The second part of the workshop focuses on specific applications on the social sciences. `03_line_plots.R', for example, generates a figure showing the evolution of the unemployment rate in the U.S., similar to the plot on pages 85-97 of the ggplot2 book. `04_coefficients_plots.R' shows how to produce a regression coefficient plots, with confidence intervals, on ggplot2 (shown below).
